We are two startups recently selected for the [PnP Bitcoin accelerator](http://www.coindesk.com/plug-play-unveils-bitcoin-startup-incubator-expert-mentors/). Both of our companies have a requirement for Multi-Sig support with HD Bitcoin wallets. We want to join forces and push the development of this technology in a fashion that is benficial to the entire Bitcoin ecosystem. 

One of our initiatives to achieve this is the issuence of bounties: Solve the issue, get paid!

We have deposited 5 BTC [here](https://blockchain.info/address/1C2zaVZBwLfS4mJAgjKKVPp8xppVxeLTMN):
```
1C2zaVZBwLfS4mJAgjKKVPp8xppVxeLTMN
```

The funds in this address will be payed out for the amount stated on each issue. If we receive more donations to this address, we will create additional tasks and assign the funds and bounties to them.

As soon as technically feasible, we will implement a Multi-Sig voting pool to distribute the bounties.

If you don't have the right skills, but love Bitcoin, we will graciously accept donations.


What we need
------------

We have researched implementations that suit our requirements for running mobile android wallets. We consider *bitcoinj* the most advanced and independent community driven implementation for mobile and want to focus our efforts on it. We are looking for like-minded developers with a good understanding of Bitcoin and it's underlying cryptography. The goal is the implementation of "married wallets" as described in this [design document by Mike Hearn](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/bitcoinj/Uxl-z40OLuQ/e2m4mEWR6gMJ):
