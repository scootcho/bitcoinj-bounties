Proposal to Accelerate Development of Married Wallets/BIP32 in bitcoinj
=================

We are two startups in the PnP Bitcoin accelerator. Both of our companies have a need in Multi-Sig support with HD Bitcoin wallets. We want to join forces and push the development of this tech in a fashion that is benficial to the Bitcoin ecosystem. To achieve that, we decided to issue bounties.

We have researched implementations that suit our requirements for running mobile android wallets. We consider bitcoinj the most advanced and independent community driven implementation for mobile and want to focus our efforts on it. We are looking like-minded developers with a good understanding of Bitcoin and it's underlying cryptography. The goal is the implementation of "married wallets" as described by a design document
